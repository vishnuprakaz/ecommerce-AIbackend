# Development TODO

## 🔥 Critical Issues
- [x] ✅ Fix OpenAI initialization - app crashes without API key, should gracefully handle missing keys
- [x] ✅ Tool execution is returning mock data - need actual implementations
- [x] ✅ Add proper error handling for malformed A2A requests

## 🚀 Sprint 1 - Core Functionality ✅ COMPLETE!
- [x] ✅ Implement basic tool handlers (navigate, search_products, add_to_cart)
- [x] ✅ Add request validation and error responses
- [x] ✅ Create simple HTML test client for streaming endpoint
- [x] ✅ Add basic logging (replace print statements)

## 🧠 Sprint 2 - Smart Agent
- [ ] Integrate LangGraph for proper agent workflows
- [ ] Add function calling to OpenAI requests (currently just chat)
- [ ] Implement tool parameter validation with Pydantic
- [ ] Add conversation context/memory

## 🔧 Sprint 3 - Production Ready
- [ ] Session management for multi-turn conversations
- [ ] Rate limiting for OpenAI API calls
- [ ] Add more ecommerce tools (filters, sorting, wishlist)
- [ ] Database setup for session storage

## ✅ Testing & Quality
- [ ] Unit tests for agent and tool logic
- [ ] Integration tests for A2A streaming
- [ ] Add basic monitoring/health checks
- [ ] Performance testing for streaming

## 📦 Deployment
- [ ] Docker setup 
- [ ] Environment configuration management
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline (GitHub Actions)
- [ ] Demo frontend app

## 🐛 Known Issues
- ~~OpenAI client requires API key at startup~~ ✅ Fixed - now gracefully handles missing keys
- A2A streaming chunks might be too fast/slow - need testing
- ~~No input validation on tool parameters~~ ✅ Fixed - comprehensive A2A validation added

## 📝 Development Notes
- Current agent is very basic - just passes messages to OpenAI
- Need to research LangGraph patterns for ecommerce workflows
- Consider adding authentication layer later
- UV package management is working great 👍
- OpenAI mock mode working perfectly for development without API key
- Tool handlers now return structured data with UI updates - much better!
- Added tool testing endpoint at `/tools/execute` for development
- A2A error handling is now comprehensive with proper validation and error responses
- Regular endpoints now have proper validation too - much more robust
- HTML test client at `/test` makes development much easier!
- Proper logging is now in place - much more professional

## 🎯 Current Focus
🎉 **Sprint 1 Complete!** Starting **Sprint 2** - integrating LangGraph for smarter agent workflows.
