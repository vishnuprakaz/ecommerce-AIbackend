# Ecommerce Agent Backend

Building an AI agent for conversational ecommerce using A2A protocol and LangGraph.

## What I'm Building

Trying to create an AI agent that can control ecommerce UIs through natural language. User says "show me red bags under $100" and the agent navigates, filters, and manipulates the interface automatically.

## Tech Stack

- A2A Protocol for agent communication
- LangGraph for workflow management  
- OpenAI for the LLM
- FastAPI for the backend

## Status

ðŸš§ Work in progress - just getting started

## Setup

Will add proper setup instructions as I build this out.

## Notes

This is part of a larger ecommerce project. The frontend will consume the A2A streams to update the UI in real-time.
