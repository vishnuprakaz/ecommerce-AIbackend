## Unlock Collaborative Agent Scenarios [¬∂](https://a2aproject.github.io/A2A/latest/\#unlock-collaborative-agent-scenarios "Permanent link")

The **Agent2Agent (A2A) Protocol** is an open standard designed to enable seamless communication and collaboration between AI agents. In a world where agents are built using diverse frameworks and by different vendors, A2A provides a common language, breaking down silos and fostering interoperability.

Introducing A2A Protocol for AI Agents \| Holt S. posted on the topic \| LinkedIn

ü§ñ A2A Protocol Introduction

They're here, they're there, they're every-freaking-where, AI Agents! AI Agents!
#TedLasso


And as these agents rapidly expand in scope, they need a consistent way to communicate with each other. The Agent2Agent (A2A) protocol, created by Google, is an open standard for all AI Agents to follow. Here's a video outlining the concepts and implementation of the protocol so the world can multi-agent systems across any Agentic frameworks!

### Why A2A Matters [¬∂](https://a2aproject.github.io/A2A/latest/\#why-a2a-matters "Permanent link")

![A2A Main Graphic](https://a2aproject.github.io/A2A/latest/assets/a2a-main.png)

- **Interoperability**

Connect agents built on different platforms (LangGraph, CrewAI, Semantic Kernel, custom solutions) to create powerful, composite AI systems.

- **Complex Workflows**

Enable agents to delegate sub-tasks, exchange information, and coordinate actions to solve complex problems that a single agent cannot.

- **Secure & Opaque**

Agents interact without needing to share internal memory, tools, or proprietary logic, ensuring security and preserving intellectual property.

### A2A and MCP: Complementary Protocols [¬∂](https://a2aproject.github.io/A2A/latest/\#a2a-and-mcp-complementary-protocols "Permanent link")

![A2A MCP Graphic](https://a2aproject.github.io/A2A/latest/assets/a2a-mcp-readme.png)

A2A and the [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) are complementary standards for building robust agentic applications:

- **MCP (Model Context Protocol):** Connects agents to **tools, APIs, and resources** with structured inputs/outputs. Think of it as the way agents access their capabilities.
- **A2A (Agent2Agent Protocol):** Facilitates **dynamic, multimodal communication between different agents** as peers. It's how agents collaborate, delegate, and manage shared tasks.
